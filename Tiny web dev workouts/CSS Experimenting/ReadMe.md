Transition and Transformation

1. transitions make the element smoothly and gradually change
2. transforms move or change the appearance of an element

Transition

1. transition-property
2. transition-duration

transition shorthand -> for cleaner and faster code

div {
    transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
}

property and duration are "Required"
